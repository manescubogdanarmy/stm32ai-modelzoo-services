# How can I define and train my own model with ST Model Zoo?

With ST Model Zoo, you can easily define and train your own TensorFlow neural network model.

## Define my model

First, create your own model in /src/models/custom_model.py for it to be automatically used with the model zoo training script.
Open the python file and copy your model topology inside, here is the default example model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, DepthwiseConv2D, UpSampling2D, Activation, Add, BatchNormalization, ReLU, MaxPooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import L2

def custom(input_shape, nb_keypoints):

    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Define the feature extraction layers
    x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False)(inputs)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = ReLU()(x)
    x = MaxPooling2D()(x)
    x = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = ReLU()(x)
    x = MaxPooling2D()(x)
    x = Conv2D(256, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = ReLU()(x)

    x = Conv2D(nb_keypoints, kernel_size=1, padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)

    outputs  = Activation('sigmoid')(x)

    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name= "custom")

    return model
```

The model must be created inside the function get_custom_model. The input size and number of classes are then define in the user_config.yaml. See below.

The nb_keypoints of the pose is difined in the yaml, see below in the example. Be careful about the last convolution layer that uses this parameter.


## Training my model

To train the model, we then edit the user_config.yaml and run the training using the python script stm32ai_main.py.

### Dataset

For this example, we used the COCO2017 pose estimation dataset. 

You can use any dataset of the YOLO Darknet format. You can take a look at this [tutorial](./how_to_use_my_own_dataset.md) which explain how to convert a COCO dataset using our script.

### Operation modes:

Depending on what you want to do, you can use the operation modes below:
- Training:
    - To simply train the model and get as output the trained tensorflow model (.h5).
- Chain_tqe:
    - To train, quantize and evaluate the model in one go. You get as ouput both the train and quantized trained models (.h5 and .tflite)
- Chain_tqeb:
    - To train, quantize, evaluate and benchmark the quantized model in one go.

For any details regarding the parameters of the config file, you can look here:

- [Training documentation](../README_TRAINING.md)
- [Quantization documentation](../README_QUANTIZATION.md)
- [Benchmark documentation](../README_BENCHMARKING.md)
- [Evaluation documentation](../README_EVALUATION.md)


### Benchmarking Configuration example:

The most important parts here are to define:
- The operation mode to training
- The data paths
- Define the number of keypoints of the pose
- The model name to custom for model zoo to load the model in custom_model.py
- The input_shape and other training parameters

You can also find example of user_config.yaml for any operation mode [here](../../src/config_file_examples)

## Run the script:

Edit the user_config.yaml then open a terminal (make sure to be in the UC folder). Finally, run the command:

```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py
```
You can also use any .yaml file using command below:
```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path=path_to_the_folder_of_the_yaml --config-name=name_of_your_yaml_file
```
