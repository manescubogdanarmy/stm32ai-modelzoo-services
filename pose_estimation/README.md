# Pose estimation STM32 model zoo

## Directory Components:
* [datasets](./docs/README_DATASETS.md) placeholder for the pose estimation datasets.
* [docs](./docs/) contains all readmes and documentation specific to the pose estimations use case.
* [src](./docs/README_OVERVIEW.md) contains tools to evaluate, benchmark, quantize and deploy your model on your STM32 target.

## Quick & easy examples:
The `operation_mode` top-level attribute specifies the operations or the service you want to execute. This may be single operation or a set of chained operations.

You can refer to readme links below that provide typical examples of operation modes, and tutorials on specific services:

   - [quantization, chain_eqe, chain_qb](./docs/README_QUANTIZATION.md)
   - [evaluation, chain_eqeb](./docs/README_EVALUATION.md)
   - [benchmarking](./docs/README_BENCHMARKING.md)
   - [prediction](./docs/README_PREDICTION.md)
   - deployment, chain_qd ([STM32N6](./docs/README_DEPLOYMENT_STM32N6.md), [STM32MPU](./docs/README_DEPLOYMENT_MPU.md))

All .yaml configuration examples are located in [config_file_examples](./src/config_file_examples/) folder.

The different values of the `operation_mode` attribute and the corresponding operations are described in the table below. In the names of the chain modes, 'e' stands for evaluation, 'q' for quantization, 'b' for benchmark and 'd' for deployment on an STM32 board.

| operation_mode attribute | Operations |
|:---------------------------|:-----------|
| `evaluation` | Evaluate the accuracy of a float or quantized model on a test or validation dataset|
| `quantization` | Quantize a float model |
| `prediction`   | Predict the classes some images belong to using a float or quantized model |
| `benchmarking` | Benchmark a float or quantized model on an STM32 board |
| `deployment`   | Deploy a model on an STM32 board |
| `chain_eqe`    | Sequentially: evaluation of a float model,  quantization, evaluation of the quantized model |
| `chain_qb`     | Sequentially: quantization of a float model, benchmarking of quantized model |
| `chain_eqeb`   | Sequentially: evaluation of a float model,  quantization, evaluation of quantized model, benchmarking of quantized model |
| `chain_qd`     | Sequentially: quantization of a float model, deployment of quantized model |


The `model_type` attributes currently supported for the pose estimation are:
- `spe`: These are single pose estimation models that outputs directly the keypoints positions and confidences.
- `hand_spe`: These are single hand landmarks estimation models that outputs directly the keypoints positions and confidences of the hand pose.
- `head_spe`: These are single head landmarks estimation models that outputs directly the keypoints positions and confidences of the head pose.
- `heatmaps_spe`: These are single pose estimation models that outputs heatmaps that we must 
post-process in order to get the keypoints positions and confidences.
- `yolo_mpe `: These are the YOLO (You Only Look Once) multiple pose estimation models from Ultralytics based on the well known Yolov8 that outputs the same tensor as in object detection but with the addition of a set of keypoints for each bbox.

Remember that minimalistic yaml files are available [here](./src/config_file_examples/) to play with specific services, and that all pre-trained models in the [STM32 model zoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/) are provided with their configuration .yaml file used to generate them. These are very good starting points to start playing with!
