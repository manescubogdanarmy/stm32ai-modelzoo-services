print("\n1. TRAINING SUMMARY:")
print("   - Model: STM-MNIST (8,552 parameters)")
print("   - Training Accuracy: 99.98%")
print("   - Validation Accuracy: 100%")
print("   - Dataset: 8,000 images (1,000 per class)")
print("   - Format: 2x16 pixels â†’ resized to 32x32")
print("   - Classes: 8 sensor states (7 alerts + normal)")

print("\n2. TESTING RESULTS:")
print("   - Test Accuracy: 0% (0/12 correct)")
print("   - All predictions below 0.5 threshold")
print("   - Predictions show minimal variation across inputs")
print("   - Model consistently predicts same probability distribution")

print("\n3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
print("   ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:")
print("   a) Model learned to predict average class distribution, not features")
print("   b) Training may have had data leakage or preprocessing issues") 
print("   c) 100% validation accuracy is suspicious - indicates overfitting")
print("   d) Model weights may not have learned meaningful patterns")
print("   e) Possible issue with loss function or training configuration")

print("\n4. EVIDENCE:")
print("   - All test predictions converge to: [9%, 15%, 23%, 5%, 5%, 26%, 10%, 4%]")
print("   - Class 5 (high_stress) always highest probability (~26%)")
print("   - No significant variation between different input patterns")
print("   - Model fails on both individual sensors and combinations")
print("   - Even 'all black' vs 'all white' produces nearly identical predictions")

print("\n5. TRAINING DATA INSPECTION:")
print("   - Format: 2x16 pixels with sparse patterns")
print("   - High_body_temperature: pixels [0:3] = 255")
print("   - Muscle_fatigue: pixels [2:5] = 255") 
print("   - EMG_fatigue: pixels [4:7] = 255")
print("   - Poor_posture: pixels [6:9] = 255")
print("   - High_env_temperature: pixels [8:10] = 255")
print("   - High_stress: pixels [10:12] = 255")
print("   - Eye_fatigue: pixels [12:14] = 255")
print("   - Normal: all pixels = 0")

print("\n6. POSSIBLE CAUSES:")
print("   a) Multi-label classification setup may be incorrect")
print("   b) Loss function (binary_crossentropy) may not be working properly")
print("   c) Sigmoid activation producing values all below 0.5")
print("   d) Training data generation may have issues")
print("   e) Model architecture too simple for the task")
print("   f) Learning rate or optimization issues")

print("\n7. RECOMMENDATIONS:")
print("   ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:")
print("   1. Retrain with different configuration:")
print("      - Lower learning rate (0.0001 instead of 0.001)")
print("      - Different loss function (focal loss or weighted BCE)")
print("      - Add class weights to handle any imbalance")
print("      - Use different activation (softmax for single-label?)")
print("   ")
print("   2. Verify training data:")
print("      - Check dataset generation script for bugs")
print("      - Validate that training images match expected patterns")
print("      - Ensure proper train/validation split")
print("   ")
print("   3. Model architecture changes:")
print("      - Add more layers or neurons")
print("      - Add batch normalization")
print("      - Try different model architecture")
print("   ")
print("   4. Training monitoring:")
print("      - Add more detailed logging")
print("      - Monitor individual class performance")
print("      - Use learning curves to detect overfitting early")

print("\n8. TRAINING CONFIGURATION ISSUES:")
print("   Current config analysis:")
print("   - Multi-label classification with sigmoid + binary_crossentropy")
print("   - This setup expects multiple classes to be active simultaneously")
print("   - All current predictions are below 0.5 threshold")
print("   - Model appears to have learned the wrong pattern")

print("\n9. NEXT STEPS:")
print("   âœ… Option A: Retrain with corrected configuration")
print("   âœ… Option B: Switch to single-label classification if appropriate")
print("   âœ… Option C: Debug training data generation process")
print("   âœ… Option D: Use a different model architecture")
